Emacs is a *text editor* which you can customize and extend in so many
ways. It was written in *Lisp*, the language from which /the Gods
wrought the universe/.

There's a reason why Emacs was [[http://jtnimoy.net/workviewer.php?q%3D178][featured in Tron Legacy]], it is sexy!
(and awesome).

You can use Emacs for all of your text processing needs, internet and
social network interactions, hacking, coding, managing to-do's and
organizing your daily schedule, play Tetris and it can even provide
you with free psychotherapy and counseling using =M-x doctor=.

#+HTML: <img src="img/emacs-logo.png" alt="Emacs" class="left" />

GNU Emacs is *Free Software*, free as in beer and free as in free
speech. The original Emacs was written by /St. iGNUcius himself/ -
*Richard Stallman*.

Not only does it give the user the [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][four essential freedoms]], its
architecture is built in such a way that you have the power to mold
it, change it and make it comply to your computering needs.

#+HTML: <img src="img/emacs-icon.png" alt="Install Emacs" class="right">
You can install Emacs on almost every operative system out there. The
officially supported systems are GNU, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Mac OS X, MS Windows and Solaris.

** GNU/Linux
GNU Emacs is available on most GNU/Linux distributions. It's
available out of the box on some of them. If it's not, you can
use your system's package manager (apt, yum, pacman, etc.)
or [[http://gnu.c3sl.ufpr.br/ftp/emacs/][download Emacs from the GNU site]].

** Windows
You can download Emacs for Windows
from [[http://gnu.c3sl.ufpr.br/ftp/emacs/windows/][the GNU servers]].

** Mac OS X
Emacs is included in Mac OS X, so you can just use Terminal.app, type
=emacs= and you're ready to roll. It's a very old version though, and
it's recommended that you use the latest stable version which is
Emacs 24.

There are various ways to install the latest Emacs on Mac OS X:

 * Download [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][Emacs for Mac OS X]].
 * Install using Homebrew.
 * [[https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port][Emacs Mac Port]].

    Mastering Emacs is not the goal, it's the path.

#+END_QUOTE

It's not called the /self-documenting real-time display editor/ for
nothing. Emacs includes a great tutorial to *teach you how to use
Emacs while you're using Emacs*.  Mind blown? This is just the
beginning.

Once you've installed Emacs, start it up. You will be greeted with a
welcome screen. From there you can click on the /Emacs Tutorial/ link
with your mouse.

 *Instead of using your mouse*, you can press =Alt + X= on your
keyboard, which will take you to the /command mode/ on the lower
screen of Emacs. Then write =help-with-tutorial= and press Enter. You
just entered the first of many Emacs commands. You know the warm
fuzzies you just got? Get used to it, because there's more where that
came from.

This interactive tutorial will teach you the basics on how to move
around and edit text. It's just the tip of the iceberg, and your quest
has just begun.
